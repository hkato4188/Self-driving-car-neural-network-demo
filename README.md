Self driving car simulation based off of Radu's FreeCodeCamp course.
Each component is coded without the use of libraries.
Car component is modeled to reflect physics and self-driving sensors demonstrate the mechanics of neural networks.

To learn about this project, feel free to clone and serve the index.html file (opening with Live Server is recommended).

To restart the self-driving brain, click the trash can in the middle of the screen.
If a simulation performs particularly well, save that instance by clicking the save button in the middle of the screen.  Continue to save each simulation that improves performance to train your AI until it safely passes all the traffic!
