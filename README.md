Self driving car simulation based off of Radu's FreeCodeCamp course.
Each component is coded without the use of libraries.
For example, the Car component is modeled to reflect physics and life-like simulated controls and even self-driving sensors to demonstrate the mechanics of neural networks.

To interact with this project, feel free to clone and serve the index.html file (opening with Live Server is recommended).

To restart the self-driving brain, click the trash can in the middle of the screen.
If a simulation performs particularly well, save that instance by clicking the save button in the middle of the screen.  Continue to save each simulation that improves performance to train your AI until it safely passes all the traffic!

Enjoy :)

Extra tidbit:
If you want to take the car for a test drive, you can update the main.js file line 67 from "AI" to "KEYS" to update the controller to listen to keyboard directional inputs (you may also want to update the constant N since you will not need to generate multiple cars to train the AI).
